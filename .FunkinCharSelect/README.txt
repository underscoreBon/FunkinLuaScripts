Welcome to n_bonnie2's Character Select!

I have removed the legacy .json system, as its too difficult for the average fnf fan
i have replaced it with an TXT system.
its simple:

Character Display name::Character .json File name (example: bf, pico, bf-pixel)

Do I HAVE to go into detail?

You just paste the character's Spritesheet into images in it's intended place
Then paste the character's icons (300x150) into images/icons/
and you get the character's psych character json in characters/
if not, use the character editor there are tutorials on YouTube on how to use it.
After that, add the character to the character list.

now each stage type has its own set of characters, due to the nature of these stages
