Welcome to n_bonnie2's Character Select!

As you can see there are 2 TXT files, they represent the pixel and regular stages,
the syntax is as follows:

Character Display name::BF Character .json File name (example: bf, pico, bf-pixel)::GF Character .json File name (example: bf, pico, bf-pixel)

(or use [default] to use the default character.)

Do I HAVE to go into detail?

You just paste the character's Spritesheet into images in it's intended place
Then paste the character's icons (300x150) into images/icons/
and you get the character's psych character json in characters/
if not, use the character editor there are tutorials on YouTube on how to use it.
After that, add the character to the character list.

now each stage type has its own set of characters, due to the nature of these stages

1.2 -  The Final Update

- Added a optional gf field in character selection
- made the default character more softcoded than it already its and can be referenced by using [default] in either of the character fields
- animate atlases no longer make the game tweak out
- added placeholder image for no goddamn reason
- removed the hero, brian
